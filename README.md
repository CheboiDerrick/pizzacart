# **PIZZA 'n CHILL**
#### Pizza n' Chill is an online pizza store that enables customers to order for different pizza types.
#### By **Cheboi Derrick**
## Description
The website allows a user to place an order for a pizza and be notified of the total cost. The user can then decide to have a delivery or a pickup. If the user uses a delivery, they need to be prompted for their name and a location for the delivery. 
The cost of the pizza depends on the size, type of crust and the toppings a customer chooses. The user input should also be validated to avoid erroneus orders.
